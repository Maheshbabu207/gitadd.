In Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), an "arbitrary precision calculator" refers to a program or algorithm designed to perform calculations on numbers of any size, essentially without limitations on the number of digits, unlike standard data types which have fixed precision limits; it uses data structures like linked lists to store large numbers digit by digit, allowing for calculations on extremely large integers or decimals, often using "long arithmetic" methods like those taught in school for manual calculations.
